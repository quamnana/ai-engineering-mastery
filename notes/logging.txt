What is Logging?
    Logging is the process of recording important events and actions that happen inside an AI system so developers can understand what the system did, when it did it, and why.

Why Do AI Apps Use Logging?
    1. Debugging: If something breaks or behaves strangely, logs help developers trace the problem.
    2. Monitoring System Health: Performance issues, crashes, slow responses, token usage or errors show up in logs.
    3. Safety & Reliability; Developers can check whether the AI made unsafe requests, failed to call tools, or hit limits.
    4. Compliance and Auditing: Apps may track interactions, not personal identity, to see which features work well.

What To Log?
    System/Tech Logs:
        - Timestamp when a request was made
        - Length of input/output
        - Whether a tool was called (e.g., web search, database)
        - Errors, failures, latency 
        - System warnings or limits

    AI Behavior Logs
        - Which models were used
        - Prompts sent to the model (sometimes anonymized)
        - Responses generated (for debugging or training)

    Application-Level Logs
        - When a user clicked a button 
        - When an API endpoint was hit
        - Usage statistics (non-personal)

What SHOULD NOT Be Logged (Ethically)
    - Responsible AI systems avoid logging:
    - Sensitive personal information
    - Minimally necessary prompts (especially from minors)
    - Data that can identify individuals
    - Anything not required for safety or function

    Apps should also let users delete their data when possible.

Logging Lifecycle:
    User Interaction → Log Events → Store Logs → Analyze Logs → Identify Issues → Fix and Improve → Better User Experience
